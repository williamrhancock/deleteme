# Optional requirements for local fine-tuning
# Only install if you have a GPU and want to fine-tune locally
# For Mac/CPU users, use a service provider instead (Colab, Kaggle, etc.)

# Unsloth for fine-tuning (GPU recommended)
# Note: On Mac, xformers won't build, so use unsloth without colab-new extras
unsloth>=2024.1

# For GPU environments, you can also install:
# bitsandbytes>=0.41.0  # For 4-bit quantization
# unsloth[colab-new]>=2024.1  # Includes xformers (GPU only)
